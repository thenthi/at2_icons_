**Black Squares Activity**
![picture](blacksquares.png)

For this activity, I also used the tool to create squares and after that filled it by black color. Moreover, I also group 4 squares together in order to align the shape in the middle and also group the squares help me easy to move the most beautiful shape into the big white box below. The first requirement is order, I just try to make 8 different shapes look order such as made line or arranged in an alternating pattern. The second is increase, I try to arrange 4 square in ascending order - from tallest to shortest and from smallest to largest. Additionally, try to design them in a visiually appealing way using basic design techniques. The next one is bold, this one is really hard for me, just use 4 squares and I can not make it become rectangles, so I just try to make a big square and then change their positions in per white boxes in order to make it look as bold as possible. For the fourh one (congested), I created chaotic sqaures by overlapping them randomly. There proportions are irregular, and they are arranged in a messy, unstructured way. The next one is tension, I drew suqares that seem overwhelmed with anxiety, curling into a corner and desperately seeking an escape. Each square embodies a different form of worry. The final is playful, I tried to create playful shapes using four squares, arranging them in a way that forms quirky and humorous figures.

For the assignment 2, legacy is the prompt that appeal to me the most
