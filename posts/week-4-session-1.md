**Black Squares Activity**
![picture](blacksquares.png)

For this activity, I also used the tool to create squares and after that filled it by black color. Moreover, I also grouped 4 squares together in order to align the shape in the middle and also group the squares help me easy to moved the most beautiful shape into the big white box below. The first requirement is order, I just tried to make 8 different shapes look order such as made line or arranged in an alternating pattern. The second is increase, I tried to arrange 4 square in ascending order - from tallest to shortest and from smallest to largest. Additionally, trying to design them in a visiually appealing way using basic design techniques. The next one is bold, this one is really hard for me, just used 4 squares and I can not make it become rectangles, so I just try to make a big square and then changed their positions in per white boxes in order to make it look as bold as possible. For the fourh one (congested), I created chaotic sqaures by overlapping them randomly. There proportions were irregular, and they were arranged in a messy, unstructured way. The next one is tension, I drew suqares that seem overwhelmed with anxiety, curling into a corner and desperately seeking an escape. Each square embodied a different form of worry. The final is playful, I tried to create playful shapes using four squares, arranging them in a way that forms quirky and humorous figures.

**Platform**

The icons are designed for a menu of a study history in Viet Nam application (such as Lịch sử Việt Nam Toàn Tập), where users form all around the world explore about history, tradition and culture in Viet Nam. Thanks to this app, many people can understang more about a legacy and moreover they can gain more knowledge about history in many countries. This design is suitable for both mobile and desktop platforms, providing users with visual motivation as they work toward their goals.

**Context**

Each icon has its own unique function—it could represent traditional clothing, musical instruments, ancient heritage, or even majestic natural landscapes that attract tourists. Each icon symbolizes a different aspect of knowledge, allowing users to explore and learn more based on the image they are interested in.

**Audience**

The target audience spans all age groups—from children and students to adults—because my goal is to spread cultural values to everyone across the country. Moreover, the app can help users continuously update and enrich their knowledge. The simple design style, combined with colorful and playful visuals, makes it especially appealing to tech-savvy users, particularly younger generations.
