For me, the basketball with the fire is the best one and it appeal to me the most. Whenever, I drew about basketball, it sounds like full of energy and sporty. Therefore, the ball with fire can hep me conveyed most of the ideas I wanted the audience to understand.

I told before that the prompt I choose was legacy, so for the all concepts I drew is almost about legacy in Viet Nam. I want to show to the audiences cultures, customs and also traditions. Moreover, it may be beautiful scenery and musical instruments in Viet Nam. For the 45 concepts, I drew it in various images so as to help the audiences have diverse perspectives when they looking at the images.

**1. Rice Grain**

I choose a bowl of rice beacuse this is the most difficult one that I drew, I want to show that a bowl of rice is the result during the farmer work hard in the fields. I had to draw the ellipse and align it and the next step I drew rice (the shape looks like a cloud) and also use the rectangle to draw the chopsticks. All of this combine together and it make a hot bowl of rice, I have to use many shapes to create this picture.

**2. Buffalo**

For the buffalo, I choose the last one because whenever people mention buffalo we can also imagine about stength and healthiness. In the past, people in Viet Nam also used buffalo to collect the rice grain but nowadays people just you high-tech machines. Therefore, the buffalo that I drew looks big, strong and also healthy. To draw this one, I just try to draw it big with a giant buffalo horn.

**3. House**

I choose the third one, this is a straw house which is one of the traditional house in Viet Nam, ethnic people in remote areas often live in these houses. For this house, people just use wood to bild the frame of the house, and then straw is laid on top. To draw this house, I chose a rectangle for the body of the house and the triangle for the roof. I also drew some straight lines to make the stairs because in the past there are many wild animals, the house must be built high to avoid wild animals.

**4. Clothes**

For clothes I choose the second one because "Ao Dai" is traditional cloth in Viet Nam, almost Vietnamese people combine it with "Non La" -> a basic hat in Viet Nam but it also a traditional cloth. Most of Vietnamese people wear it whenever we have important national holidays. In addition, all the high school in my country, both teachers and students always wear "Ao Dai" at the beginning of the week. The "Ao Dai" symbolizes the grace and elegance of Vietnamese women, so I tried to use delicate brushstrokes and include "Non La" to highlight the culture and heritage of this country.

**5. Drum**

I choose the second drum because it looks the most closely resembles the Dong Son bronze drum from Vietnam. It captures the patterns and structure that reflect our culture heritage. The Dong Son bronze drum is a symbol of ancient Vietnamese civilization and these drums were in used in rituals, festivals, and as symbols of power. Because the features on Dong Son bronze drum is quite hard to draw, I just tried to draw the drum in the most traditional way, as it is commonly used during festivals, espically the Tet holiday.

**6. Lotus**

I am interested in the last one beacuse it is the most beautiful lotus. Lotus is also one of the symbols of Viet Nam. The lotus represents purity and grace, along with s simple yet noble beauty and it sometimes appear on traditional chothes like "Ao Dai". So for the icon that I choose, this one is the biggest and most beautiful, I tried to draw it as symmetrically and harmoniously as possible so that the audience can easily feel its meaning. 

**7. Scenery**

The second one is my choice beacause all the rest is just about the simple scenery which is peaceful annd make me people feel comfortable. The one that I choos is one of the famous tourist attractions in Viet Nam (Ha Long bay) and it is also one the most beautiful place in Viet Nam. Morethan just its stunning beauty , Ha Long Bay is steeped in legends and rich in cultural and historical significance. For this icon, I try to draw it as accurately as possible. I drew scenery Ã² Ha Long Bay at sunset.

**8. Pipa**

I like the first pipa because this one interested me the most and this one is also the most dificult of this concept. Pipa is one of traditional musical instruments in Viet Nam audiences mostly see the pipa in remote mountainous areas, where ethnic minority groups use it to perform traditional songs unique to their regions. So as to draw this icon, I try to show the body and string on the Vietnamese pipa. I want the audiences can imagine how it work whenever people use it.

**9. Dragon**

The dragon is also one of the most famous sacred creatures in Vietnam since ancient times. The icon I choose is the second one because it looks both grand and powerful, but it looks a bit cute on this icon->graceful and cloud-like. Dragon in Viet Nam symbolizes power, nobility, prosperity, and good fortune. When I draw this icon, I just tried to combine strength and a bit of flexibility to match Vietnamese tradition.
