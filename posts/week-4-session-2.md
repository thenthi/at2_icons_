For me, the basketball with the fire is the best one and it appeal to me the most. Whenever, I drew about basketball, it sounds like full of energy and sporty. Therefore, the ball with fire can hep me conveyed most of the ideas I wanted the audience to understand.

I told before that the prompt I choose was legacy, so for the all concepts I drew is almost about legacy in Viet Nam. I want to show to the audiences cultures, customs and also traditions. Moreover, it may be beautiful scenery and musical instruments in Viet Nam. For the 45 concepts, I drew it in various images so as to help the audiences have diverse perspectives when they looking at the images.
**1. Rice Grain**
I choose a bowl of rice beacuse this is the most difficult one that I drew, I want to show that a bowl of rice is the result during the farmer work hard in the fields. I had to draw the ellipse and align it and the next step I drew rice (the shape looks like a cloud) and also use the rectangle to draw the chopsticks. All of this combine together and it make a hot bowl of rice, I have to use many shapes to create this picture.
**2. Buffalo**
For the buffalo, I choose the last one because whenever people mention buffalo we can also imagine about stength and healthiness. In the past, people in Viet Nam also used buffalo to collect the rice grain but nowadays people just you high-tech machines. Therefore, the buffalo that I drew looks big, strong and also healthy. To draw this one, I just try to draw it big with a giant buffalo horn.
**3. House**
