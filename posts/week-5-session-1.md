# Tracing activity

I selected two Edward Hopper paintings—”Light House Hill” and “Early Sunday” to trace in Adobe Illustrator, using the Pen Tool for organic forms on “Light House Hill” and the Shape Tool for geometric forms on “Early Sunday.”

**Light House Hill**

For "Light House Hill" I imported the image and traced the house, the observatory's figures and also the field with the Pen Tool, I adjusted anchot point to keep the stability of the house and observatory. I traced the swaying of the field and the coolness of the sky to ensure that the painting’s sense of tranquility and comfort was preserved. The Pen Tool was challenging due to its precision demands, but thanks to that, it creates images that feel soft and warm to us.

**Early Sunday**

 For "Early Sunday" I traced the street buildings' rectangular windows, elongated storefronts, and horizontal skyline using the Shape Tool. In order to highlight the architecture's emptiness and stillness, I kept the straight street line and its geometric contours. The procedure was more accurate and faster thanks to the Shape Tool.

From all the color schemes, monochromatic color was the one that I liked the most because the prompt I chose is "legacy". Therefore, I needed the colors look colorful like yellow and green so it cold make my icon bold and majestic, these icons were designed so that when people looked at them, they could understand the value of culture and heritage, while still preserving a sense of tradition. The other two schemes didn’t work well: the analogus colors were quite uniform, rather muted and dark, creating a heavy feeling that lacks the energy I was aiming for, while the complementary and triadic colors were too right, lacking the balance between those icons.
