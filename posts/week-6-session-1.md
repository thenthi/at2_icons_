# Process

**1. Rice grain and Field**

The first one I choose is the rice grain and field, everyone know that rice is an essential and important food for many households. To produce it, farmers have to go through many laborious processes, and I believe it is also one of Vietnam's precious heritages, as my country is one of the world's leading rice exporters. That’s why I ultimately decided to use tools in Illustrator to draw rice grains and paddy fields. Combine with it was the colors that made me felt fresh and the sounds form birds that heard peaceful.

**2. Clothes**

The first icon is the picture of traditional clothes in Viet Nam "Ao Dai" and "Non La"-> one of the most important legacy. In the past, many Vietnamese people wore this outfit because it was their everyday clothing. Today, with economic development, people have shifted to more modern and comfortable clothes, but they haven’t forgotten their culture — traditional attire is still worn on important holidays and celebrations. For design, I use the rectagle to draw "Non La" and also Pen Tool to create another clothes, then I chose soft, gentle colors for the first image and more vibrant, energetic tones for the second one.

**3. Buffalo and Dragon**

Both buffalo and Dragon are considered traditional mascots of Vietnam, symbolizing health, prosperity, and strength. The buffalo has long supported farmers in plowing the fields, while the dragon represents wealth and power for our country. That’s why I believe they are also part of Vietnam’s cultural heritage. To illustrate them, we used the Pen Tool and adjusted anchor points — making the dragon appear soft and flowing, while still showcasing the strength of the buffalo.

**4. Drum and Pipa**

The drum and Vietnamese pipa are traditional instruments commonly used by Vietnamese people during festivals and celebrations. They produce deep, resonant sounds that reflect the rich cultural identity of our nation. The drum I wanted to highlight is the "Dong Son bronze drum" — one of Vietnam’s most iconic cultural heritages. However, due to its intricate details, I wasn’t able to replicate it exactly. To illustrate both the drum and Vietnamese pipa, I combined the use of the Pen Tool and Line Tool to create these two icons. The drum carries a bold and heroic tone, while Vietnamese pipa embodies elegance and grace. 

**5.Lotus**

The first image shows a lotus bud, while in the second, it has fully bloomed. The lotus is one of the symbolic flowers of Vietnam, representing gentleness, purity, and serenity — qualities that also reflect the traditional beauty of Vietnamese women. To draw the lotus, I used the Pen Tool and chose a soft pink tone to color its petals, bringing the flower to life in a graceful and elegant way.

**6. Straw House and Mordern House**

I created these two images to highlight the contrast between two types of houses. The thatched house is a traditional dwelling of many ethnic groups in Vietnam. Although modern houses, like the one in the second image, are now common, thatched houses are still being built and lived in by ethnic communities in remote areas. These homes represent a strong sense of cultural heritage. To illustrate both houses, I used the Shape Tool — including the Rectangle, Triangle, and Line tools — to construct the frames and roofs of each structure.

**7. Flag and Scenery**

The first icon is Vietnamese flag and the second one is scenery in Viet Nam. I created these two icons to show the audience two important aspects of Vietnam. The first is the flag of Vietnam, which is a significant cultural heritage. The second is the scenery of Vietnam, specifically Ha Long Bay, a famous tourist destination that has existed for centuries. The Vietnamese people have worked hard to preserve the natural beauty of this place until today. I used the Line Tool and Rectangle Tool to draw the flag, and for the scenery, I created a frame and used the Pen Tool to illustrate the elements inside it.

**8. Phoenix**

Both of 2 icons are about phoenix because in Vietnamese culture, the phoenix symbolizes immortality, eternity, and the everlasting honor of cultural heritage. As one of the "Four Auspicious Creatures," it represents beauty, grace, and the balance of Yin and Yang. It also embodies cultural pride and is a symbol of good fortune and tradition. To illustrate the phoenix, I used the Paintbrush tool to create soft, flowing lines. I then chose red and orange, the fiery colors typically associated with the phoenix, to color these two icons.

**9. Chung Cake**

Chung cake is one of the most well-known traditional cakes in Vietnam, especially during the Lunar New Year celebration. During Tet holiday, families often gather around to make bánh chưng together beside a wood-burning stove, as shown in the second image. This tradition has been passed down through generations and remains an important part of Vietnamese culture and heritage. To design these two icons, I used squares to draw the bánh chưng and the Shape Tool to create the stove and clay pot.
